## Content Strategy (Updated - Inspired by LemonHearted)

**Brand Positioning:**
- "Your insider's guide to Florida's East Coast" - Local experiences vs. tourist marketing
- Authentic, personal storytelling with visual proof (photos of you at locations)
- Focus on "real experiences by locals" not PR-motivated content
- Free from obvious sponsored content while naturally integrating affiliate recommendations

**Geographic Focus:**
- Primary: Volusia County (New Smyrna Beach, Daytona Beach)
- Secondary: St. Augustine, Space Coast (Cocoa Beach, Titusville)
- Content approach: Local insider knowledge vs. tourist board info

**Content Categories (LemonHearted-Inspired):**

1. **Local Adventures** (Main content pillar)
   - Unique attractions like Wizard of Oz museum
   - Hidden gems and off-the-beaten-path discoveries
   - Personal exploration with friends/family
   - Format: "I went to [place] so you don't have to wonder if it's worth it"

2. **Insider Eats** 
   - Restaurant discoveries and honest reviews
   - Local coffee shops, food trucks, hole-in-the-wall spots
   - "Where locals actually eat" vs. tourist traps
   - Format: Personal dining experiences with practical details

3. **Beach Life & Coastal Living**
   - Beach guides with real local knowledge
   - Seasonal insights (red tide, crowds, best times)
   - Practical tips (parking, amenities, safety)
